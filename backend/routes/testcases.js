  const prompt = `Given the following use case description and simulation code, create a set of test cases that cover all possible flows, including the basic flow and all alternate flows. Analyze the use case and code structure to create appropriate test cases.

Use Case Description:
${useCaseDescription}

Simulation Code:
${code}

Generate at least 20 cases that cover all the possible flows described in the use case description and code. Each test case should:

1. Cover a specific flow or scenario represented in the code.
2. Have an expected output that exactly matches the console.log statements in the provided code, including punctuation and capitalization.
3. Avoid introducing any scenarios or outcomes not present in the provided code.
4. Be structured to trigger each branch in the code at least once across the test cases.
5. Ensure that the expected outputs match the code exactlyâ€”no additional text or differences in wording.

Each test case should start with a brief, one-line description comment explaining what it's testing. The expected output should be an array of strings that matches the console.log output for that scenario.

IMPORTANT:
- Ensure that every test case directly corresponds to a flow or decision point in the provided code.
- The expected outputs must exactly match the console.log statements in the provided code, including punctuation and capitalization.
- The test cases should not introduce or test scenarios that aren't present in the code.
- Ensure that the expected outputs are correct and align perfectly with the logic of the code.

Example structure of a test case:

Dont have the "here are 20 cases" stuff. Just the cases. Below is the example code that was generated and the cases that were created. Look at how 
the cases follow exactly the code and different paths the code takes. This should be the standard for every single time test cases
are created.

Make sure that the test cases only test the code and the stuff in the code, dont test scenarios that aren't present in the code. Look at the code very closely and make sure to line up the expected outputs.
